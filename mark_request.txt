## Other Comments

If you want to let us know something else about your program, put it here!
(Feel free to leave this blank)
1. If there are problems viewing the files, please let me know.
2. Github: https://github.com/4Christinelh4/cse-pars/tree/newversion/
3. For part 2.3, as there are only few examples, my understanding is that for each client (started remotely), 
there are configurations for each client.
For example, when the command is `6991 target/debug/pars -r localhost:12345/1 --halt lazy -r localhost:12346/1`, the client on 
12345 may stop executing commands due to receiving commands like echo "1234"; /bin/false, but this will NOT affect the client on 12346, 
because they are separated.
4. For part 2, you may need to use CTRL+z to terminate the server process (the process you start by 6991 cargo run -- -r ... ).
